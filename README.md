# What does?
* Create the SteamCMD folder
* Check if the SteamCMD folder exists
* Download the SteamCMD.zip application and unzip it
* Install SteamCMD
* Run the previously configured server
* It has a watchdog that runs the server in case of update or crash
* It has an auto-update, every 15 min it checks for new updates
# Wanted
I am not a programmer but I have been making this application for a long time, the code will be very messy and there will be errors, but it is functional, it could be improved and create a much more complete tool, I hope you will cheer up and I wait for you on Discord.
